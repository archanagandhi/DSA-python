# Quick Sort

Quick sort also known as **Partition-exchange sort** is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

Two best partition methods are:
* Hoare Partition Scheme
* Lomuto Partition Scheme

## Complexity

* Time Complexity
 
   * ```Worst Case(Big-O) - O(n^2)``` *when the list is already sorted*
   * ```Average Case(Big-Theta) - O(n logn)```

   
* Space Complexity - ``` O(logn) ```
