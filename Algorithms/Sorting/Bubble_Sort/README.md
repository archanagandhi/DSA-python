# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort also known as **sinking sort** is a simple sorting algorithm. It is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
At each iteration last most element is correctly sorted. This Repeats until no swaps are needed.

## Complexity

* Time Complexity
 
   * ```Worst Case(Big-O) - O(n^2)```
   * ```Best Case(Big-Omega) - O(n)```  *when the list is already sorted*
   
* Space Complexity - ``` O(1) ```
