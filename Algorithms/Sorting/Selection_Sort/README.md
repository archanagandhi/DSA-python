# Merge Sort

Merge sort is one of the most efficient sorting which uses divide-and-conquer technique. The algorithm first moves from top to bottom, dividing the list into smaller and smaller parts until only the separate elements remain.

From there, it moves back up, ensuring that the merging lists are sorted.
